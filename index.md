I'm a recent graduate with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in computer science.

# Math

I was part of the 2020 polymath REU. The research project focused on the geometry of a special family of convex sets called Convex Geometries. Convex geometries have applications in computer science and operations research. It has been used to model scheduling problems and used in task planning. 

## Papers from the Project

- [30 Convex Geometries impossible to represent by circles (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05636)
- [7 Convex Geometries impossible to represent by circle (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13077)



# Computer Science
The upper division courses I took for my minor are File Structures and Database systems, Intro to Computer Security, and Theory of Computation.
