I'm a recent graduate with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in computer science.

# Math

I was part of the 2020 polymath REU. The research project focused on the geometry of a special family of convex sets. They're special because they satisfy a closure system which means the family of sets follow 3 rules. More details can be read in the convex geomety section [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid#Convex_geometries).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
