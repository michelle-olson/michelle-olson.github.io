I'm a recent graduate with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in computer science.

# Math

I was part of the 2020 polymath REU. The team I was on focused on convex geomtries. The research project focused on the geometry of a special family of convex sets. They're special because they satisfy a closure system which means the family of sets follow 3 rules. More details about the closure system can be read in the convex geomety section [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid#Convex_geometries). 

Convex geometries have applications in computer science and operations research. It's been used to model scheduling problems. It's also been used as models in learning both for human learners and for A.I.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
